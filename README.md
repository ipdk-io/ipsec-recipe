# ipsec-recipe
StrongSwan plugin implements the p4runtime and openconfig clients to configure IPsec SPD and SAD
to the target devices.
- IPsec recipe is validated on Intel target.
- Refer to https://ipdk.io/documentation/Recipes/InlineIPsec/
- YANG model for IPsec SAD: https://github.com/ipdk-io/openconfig-public/blob/master/release/models/ipsec/openconfig-ipsec-offload.yang

StrongSwan integration with Inline Crypto Engine
========================================================
1. The user should start and stop the strongSwan services as described in strongSwan manual.
2. The StrongSwan configuration files need to be configure by user as described in 
			https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/UserDocumentation
3. Make sure the P4OVS application is running before we start strongSwan services.
4. StrongSwan hosts (Host-A<---->Host-B) should be connected to negotiate the keys.
5. The user should use the best practices followed by opensource community for other control plane related configurations.
