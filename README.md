# IPsec-Recipe
The IPsec recipe is an application that enables strongSwan to use [Infrastructure Application Interface](https://ipdk.io/documentation/Interfaces/InfraApp/), specifically the P4Runtime and OpenConfig gRPCs provided by the [Networking-Recipe](https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe).

The strongSwan plugin available in this repository implements a policy-based IPsec enablement using security policy database (SPD) and security association database (SAD). The P4Runtime client introduces a programmable IPsec flow using P4 language for the SPD and OpenConfig for SAD configurability.

* IPsec recipe is validated only on Intel&reg; IPU E2100 target
* Refer to https://ipdk.io/documentation/Recipes/InlineIPsec/
* YANG model for IPsec SAD: https://github.com/ipdk-io/openconfig-public/blob/master/release/models/ipsec/openconfig-ipsec-offload.yang
* Reference P4 program to enable IPsec on DPDK target: https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe/tree/main/p4src/Inline_IPsec

strongSwan Integration with Inline Crypto Engine
========================================================
* The user should start and stop the strongSwan services as described in strongSwan manual.
* The strongSwan configuration files must be configured by user as described in 
			https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/UserDocumentation
* Confirm that the networking-recipe (the `infrap4d` process, which acts as the gRPC server) is running before starting strongSwan services.
* strongSwan hosts (Host-A<---->Host-B) should be connected to negotiate the keys.
* The user should follow best practices followed by opensource community for other control plane related configurations.
 
Getting Started
===================

Clone this repository and install the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipsec-recipe.git
cd ipsec-recipe
source env_setup_acc.sh
./install_dep_packages_acc.sh
```

Clone strongSwan and switch to version 5.9.3 (Any version can be used but verification has been completed with v5.9.3 on fedora33)

```bash
cd ipsec_offload_plugin/
git clone  https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan.git
cd strongswan/
git checkout tags/5.9.3 -b 5.9.3
cd -
```

Build strongSwan

```bash
Note: The strongswan and the plugin gets only info on IP(L3) and L4 layer. It don't have
any info on L2 mac addresses. Since in TUNNEL mode we do have a provision to add/delete
new MAC headers along with IP header, We have to use some manual MAC configuration.
This manual configurations are only needed for standalone IPSec recipe. Once IPSec and
networking recipe are integrated the MAC learning will be automatic.

Search following strings and change the value of inner_smac(MAC address of the tunnel
interface on local host) and inner_dmac(MAC address of the tunnel interface on remote host)
accordingly in the file "ipsec_offload_plugin/ipsec_offload/ipsec_offload.c"
inner_smac[16] = {0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x03, 0x14};
inner_dmac[16] = {0x84, 0x16, 0x0c, 0xba, 0x90, 0xf0};

./swanbuild_p4.sh -t native -o $DEPS_INSTALL --enable_grpc
```

After successful build, files will be installed in `./output_strongswan` directory.

Compile IPsec P4 files and generate the P4 artifacts (p4info.txt and ipsec.pb.bin). These will be used to set the P4 pipeline. See the [Compiling P4 Programs guide](https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe/blob/main/docs/guides/es2k/compiling-p4-programs.md) for details. Copy the P4 artifacts (p4info.txt and ipsec.pb.bin) in `/var/tmp/` dir with file name linux_networking.p4info.txt and ipsec_fixed_func.pb.bin.

Generate and install the keys and certificates for TLS authentication. Detailed instructions can be found in the [Generating and Installing TLS Certificates guide](https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe/blob/main/docs/guides/security/using-tls-certificates.md). The keys and certificates will need to be copied to `/usr/share/stratum/certs` folder.

Configure strongSwan
* Review the server IP addresses, client certificate filename, client key filename, client CA filename and p4 table/action names (as per p4info.txt file) in `ipsec_offload_plugin/ipsec_offload.conf` file.
* Copy the configuration file to `/usr/share/stratum`
* Update the strongSwan configuration files (eg: swanctl.conf). Please refer strongSwan documentation.
* Update the system date and stop StrongSwan service (systemctl stop strongswan.service)

Run StrongSwan

Please refer standard strongSwan user manuals to test IPsec usecases using strongSwan.
